# DataMiningProjects
Course Projects and Learning implemented in the DataMining Course

THe major code implementations are to identify if the students grade are impacted by the socio economic trends and what are the most influencing variables that could be used to change the course of action and induct changes.

THis was a good exercise done in order to complete the analysis and identif that grade prediction was challenging due to very limited data set.

Go over the jupyter files and you will understand mode on the same. 

Also I uploaded some side homeworks I did in order to finally build a project.
